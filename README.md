# Build a Modern Computer From First Principles
The code in this repository represents the exercises completed as part of the `Build a Modern Computer From First Principles` courses on Coursera. These courses walk through building a computer from low level hardware implementations all the way to high level programming languages

The courses are split into 2 parts:
1. The [first course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer?) teaches hardware implementations from low level logic gates to building a CPU
  * It also builds an Assembler
  * The code can be found in the `Part1` folder and is organized into 6 weeks
